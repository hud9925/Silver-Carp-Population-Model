# Silver Carp Population Model

## Overview
This project simulates the potential establishment and growth of the invasive Silver Carp (*Hypophthalmichthys molitrix*) populations across various Great Lakes. Using a stage-structured model, the simulation predicts how the carp population might grow under different environmental conditions over a 20-year period.

## Features

- **Simulation Coverage**: Population simulations for Lake Superior, Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, and Lake Erie.
- **Comprehensive Modeling**: Utilizes data on water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels to predict carp survivability and fecundity rates.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks (`final_simulation.ipynb`) demonstrate the simulation process and visualize the outcomes.
- **Data Driven**: Employs real-world data obtained from governmental sources to ensure the accuracy and relevancy of the simulation inputs.

## Libraries and Modules Used
- **numpy**: For numerical/array operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **SciPy and SciKit-Learn**: For ML-clustering and linear regression.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hud9925/Silver-Carp-Population-Model.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Silver-Carp-Population-Model

## Usage

To run the simulation:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
2. Unzip the .zip file in directory "Government_Data," and make sure to put it in the same directory as the notebook
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to observe the simulation process and results.

## Data Sources

- **Temperature and Oxygen Data**: Derived from [Government of Canada's environmental monitoring datasets](https://data-donnees.az.ec.gc.ca/data/substances/monitor/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-aquatic-ecosystem-health-data/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-surveillance-data/).
- **Population Dynamics Literature**: Includes various scientific studies on Silver Carp biology and ecology(as listed in the notebook).
